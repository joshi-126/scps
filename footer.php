            <p>
                SCPS is a unified platform designed to simplify and digitalize college operations.  
                It provides dedicated dashboards for Students, Faculty, and Admin with easy access  
                to academic management, e-learning, event participation, and resource sharing.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Students can track academics, report lost items, participate in events,  
                and exchange old books. Faculty members can upload marks, timetables,  
                and materials while also managing events and lost reports.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Admins have centralized control to manage students, faculty, marks,  
                attendance, events, lost items, and book exchanges efficiently.  
                SCPS ensures transparency, accessibility, and smooth coordination  
                across all departments.
